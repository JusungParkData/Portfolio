### **Summary**

Border crossings have been trending down overall in recent months, but this report highlights specific ports where traffic is changing more noticeably. By focusing on both month-over-month shifts at the local level, we uncover patterns that broader totals may overlook — helping surface emerging trends and potential operational changes.

### **Observation A:**

*First, we notice that total border crossings were averaging around 30M from Jan 2023 to Jan 2025. However, with the beginning of the Trump Presidency, we notice a significant 17% drop in crossings down from 30M to 25M in Feb 2025.

**A logical next step is to identify which specific ports experienced the largest increases or decreases in crossing volume**.

 These ports experienced the largest decreases:

While these experienced the largest increases:

*Full SQL logic is provided under notebooks

**A recommendation for border officials would be to redirect some of the resources and personnel from the decreasing ports to the increasing ones.**

Specifically, more foot patrol would be needed at ports El Paso and Columbus, while more truck lanes would be needed at port Eastport
